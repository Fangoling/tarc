                                            It is a concept in which weighted clothing is used to add resistance to familiar movements.
                                            It is safer than other forms of weighted training because no new movements need to be learned.
                                            Additionally, it increases metabolism due to the higher energy expenditure.

                                            The Draft is a system designed to introduce advertisers to companies in an exciting way.
                                            In this process, athletes are evaluated and sorted based on their statistics.
                                            These athletes are then available for selection, and can be chosen one by one.
                                            The statistical sorting serves only as a guideline and is not mandatory.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Every six months, a list of all Tarc athletes is published. Just before the summer and winter breaks,
                                            all partner companies can decide which advertiser suits them best.
                                            The order in which athletes are chosen is determined by the partner companies&apos; join dates.
                                            Companies that joined earlier have a higher position in the Draft.
                                            Therefore, the longest-standing partners have the greatest selection of popular athletes.
                                            The selection process continues until there are no more advertising slots available.
