                                <p>
                                    Weighted clothing is a concept where resistance is added to familiar movements by using clothing with implemented weights. It is safer than other forms of weighted training, as no new movement patterns need to be learned. Additionally, it boosts metabolism due to the increased energy expenditure.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Addressing the Challenges of Weighted Clothing</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The current problem with the well-developed concept behind weighted clothing is its implementation in reality. The practical execution of the simple concept of overloading bodyweight training is very complex due to physical constraints. The biggest issues here are often limited range of motion and the improper distribution of weight, which make athletic training impossible. In addition, there is the problem of washability and maintaining quality, which is also encountered in other areas of the fitness industry, such as with free weights.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Improved Weight Distribution for Optimal Performance</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Tarcs products have achieved better usability for athletic training through improved weight distribution. Additionally, care has been taken not to line the product with thick fabric, ensuring that movement remains as unrestricted as possible

                                    The Draft is a system designed to introduce advertisers to companies in an exciting way.
                                    In this process, athletes are evaluated and sorted based on their statistics.
                                    These athletes are then available for selection, and can be chosen one by one.
                                    The statistical sorting serves only as a guideline and is not mandatory.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    Every year, a list of all Tarc athletes is published and all partner companies can decide which advertiser suits them best.
                                    The order in which athletes are chosen is determined by the partner companies&apos; join dates.
                                    Companies that joined earlier have a higher position in the Draft.
                                    Therefore, the longest-standing partners have the greatest selection of popular athletes.
                                    The selection process continues until there are no more advertising slots available.
                                    <br/><br/>The first draft starts is planned to start in 2027.
